<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biometric identification is to reliably and effectively identify an individual of interest, 
where a pre-established database of biometric records is scanned with the unknown individual's 
biometric sample to look for a close enough match. This has recently been aided with cloud computing, 
where the database owner achieves higher efficiency by outsourcing a large-scale database and the computationally 
intensive identification task to the cloud, and two such schemes pursuing privacy preserving have recently been 
proposed by Wang et al. in ESORICS '15. In this paper, we first identify certain security breaches in the two schemes, 
which are illustrated with two independent types of elaborate attacks. Then we accordingly construct a new scheme called 
SCBI by introducing novel encryption algorithms for both the data and the query. Thorough theoretical analysis and experiments 
are presented to evaluate the security and efficiency. The results indicate that SCBI is both secure and feasible for practical applications.</p>
