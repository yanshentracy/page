<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> With the unique characteristics of low power consumption and low cost, IEEE 802.15.2 standard is widely used in the modern wireless networks. 
It can provide the lowest 0.006% of duty ratio to reduce power consumption, and offer real-time service for the node through the guarantee time 
slots (GTS) mechanism. However, IEEE 802.15.4 can only provide real-time guarantees service for certain nodes, which is lack of flexibility for 
large-scale networks. A shared security timeslot allocation policy by multi-node is present for overcome the shorting of special GTS allocation 
method, taking into account the traffic specifications and the delay requirements of the flows. The policy enables the use of a GTS by multiple 
nodes, and still ensure delay and bandwidth requirements. Numerical analysis clearly showed that, compared with the traditional method, the improvement 
of allocation policy can effectively improve the bandwidth utilization.</p>
