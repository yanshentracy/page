<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cyberbullying is a major issue on online social platforms, and can have prolonged negative psychological impact on both the bullies and their targets. Users can be characterized by their involvement in cyberbullying according to different social roles including victim, bully, and victim supporter. In this work, we propose a social role detection framework to understand cyberbullying on online social platforms, and select a dataset that contains users’ records on both Instagram and Ask.fm as a case study. We refine the traditional victim-bully framework by constructing a victim-bully-supporter network on Instagram. These social roles are automatically identified via ego comment networks and linguistic cues of comments. Additionally, we analyze the consistency of users’ social role within Instagram and compare users’ behaviors on Ask.fm. Our analysis reveals the inconsistency of social roles both within and across platforms, which suggests social roles in cyberbullying are not invariant by conversation, person, or social platform.</p>
