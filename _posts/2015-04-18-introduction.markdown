I am a Research Scientist at <a href = "https://research.facebook.com/"> Meta Research </a>, <a href = "https://research.facebook.com/teams/core-data-science/"> Core Data Science </a>. Prior to Meta, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at <a href = "https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a> in 2022, where I was fortunate and honored to have <a href = "http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/">Dr. Emilio Ferrara</a> as my advisor and worked as a Research Assistant at <a href="https://www.isi.edu/">Information Sciences Institute</a>. 
I got my Master's Degree in Computer Science at <a href="http://english.ucas.ac.cn/"> University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> in 2017.

My research interests lies at the intersections of <i>Human Behavior Understanding</i>, <i>Network Science</i>, and <i>AI Fairness</i>, and I am particularly interested in understanding the heterogeneity of human behaviors, and designing fairer machine learning systems. I am broadly interested in <i>Computational Social Science</i>.
