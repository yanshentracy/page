I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.isi.edu/">Information Sciences Institute</a>, <a href = "https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>. I am fortunate and honored to have <a href = "http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/">Dr. Emilio Ferrara</a> as my advisor. 
Prior to USC, I got my Master's Degree in Computer Science at <a href="http://english.ucas.ac.cn/"> University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> in 2017.

My current research lies at the intersections of Human behavior Understanding and AI Fairness, and I am particularly interested in understanding the heterogeneity of human behaviors, and designing fairer machine learning systems for human behavior estimation. I am broadly instrested in Computational Social Science.
