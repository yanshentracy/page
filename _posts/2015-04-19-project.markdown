#### Fairness-Aware Machine Learning for Multimodal Human Behavior Data
Behavioral modeling has found broad applicabilitiy in many decision-making domains, including health and job performance evaluation, financial and employment scrutiny, etc. Hence, guaranteeing model fairness in behavioral modeling is an open challenge for real-world applications. We propose and develop machine learning models that will identify, account for, and mitigate the biases of multimodal human behavior modeling methods.

#### Tracking Individual pErformance with Sensors (TILES)
<a href = "https://sail.usc.edu/tiles/">TILES</a> is a project focused on the analysis of stress, task performance, behavior, and other factors pertaining to professionals engaged in a high-stress workplace environment. Biological, environmental, and contextual data is collected from hospital nurses and staff both in the workplace and at home over a period of 10 weeks. Labels of human experience are collected using a variety of psychologically validated questionnaires sampled on a daily basis at different times during the day.

We design machine learning models to estimate human behaviors from the sensory data, which are aiming to provide promising solutions to generalizable, trust, and fair mobile health systems.
